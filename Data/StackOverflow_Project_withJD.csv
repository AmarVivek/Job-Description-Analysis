Do you want to work with a system that gets a half million logins from one hundred thousand users per month? How about write code for an industry-leading financial services platform that transacts more than ten billion dollars a year? Do you think it would be cool to be a part of the team that expands this platform to transact one trillion dollars for ten million users?  Have you ever wanted to be in a Guild?  Have you yearned to hear ""that sounds great go ahead and try it out""?You aren't dogmatic; you're pragmatic. You know that ""agile"" means adapting to deliver value to customers, not necessarily any of the individual practices surrounding it. You care about automated tests and code reviews, and when the build breaks, you don't run git blame. You find the root cause and fix it. You embrace the hard problems like localization, security, and timezones. You want to move our code, style and performance in the right direction and be an influencer.It doesn't matter if it's Ant or Gradle, Struts or Spring, jQuery or GWT - you know it or you can pick it up. You aim to build commercial products that people use - technology is just a means to an end. We are looking for developers of all experience levels to help us build a fast, reliable, secure, and resilient enterprise platform on a global scale.Things we believe:  Results matter, not the clock.     Code and technology are what we use to solve problems, not the whole of our job. Continuously Improving, learning everyday through pairing, Lunch and Learns and mentorship.      You are passionate about about what you do and you take pride in your craft. Great programmers are great programmers whether they work in Java, .Net, React Native or C++ Free tools are great unless they aren't the best. We use high-end Linux workstations with big monitors and tools like IDEA, JRebel and the Atlassian suite to keep us in the zone.  Skills & Requirements Things we like:    Prior experience with production large-scale distributed systems Familiarity with technologies we use (Java, Spring, GWT, Struts, JPA, EJB, REST)      A hunger for tracking down root causes - no matter how deep the rabbit hole       A BS in CS is appreciated but not necessary with the right background  What you'll do:  Be customer focused - learn about the business to help bring value to our customers Act technology driven - design, implement, and test new functionality    Work closely with QA - we fix our own bugs       Work with Product Management to deliver material value to our clients      Do full stack dev from the DB to the UI       Use your experience to help the whole team get better  What you'll get:           Market rate salary based on experience          An amazing on-boarding experience on Shareworks, Dev Culture, How we do things and even ""reforming"" you from .Net to Java           Participation in annual bonus plan and stock incentives   Share Purchase Plan with company contributions (we are public and profitable!)            Casual Environment - we aren’t a bank, they just happen to be clients 20 Paid Days off + 11 stat holidays (and 5 week sabbatical after 5 years) The occasional spontaneous Nerf War Relocation Assistance available for the right candidates  If you've read this far and you're thinking ""I want to be a part of this"", we agree!

You know that ""agile"" means adapting to deliver value to customers, not necessarily any of the individual practices surrounding it.

We are looking for developers of all experience levels to help us build a fast, reliable, secure, and resilient enterprise platform on a global scale.Things we believe:  Results matter, not the clock.     Code and technology are what we use to solve problems, not the whole of our job.

Great programmers are great programmers whether they work in Java, .Net, React Native or C++ Free tools are great unless they aren't the best. We use high-end Linux workstations with big monitors and tools like IDEA, JRebel and the Atlassian suite to keep us in the zone.

Do you want to work with a system that gets a half million logins from one hundred thousand users per month? How about write code for an industry-leading financial services platform that transacts more than ten billion dollars a year? Do you think it would be cool to be a part of the team that expands this platform to transact one trillion dollars for ten million users?  Have you ever wanted to be in a Guild?  Have you yearned to hear ""that sounds great go ahead and try it out""?You aren't dogmatic; you're pragmatic. You know that ""agile"" means adapting to deliver value to customers, not necessarily any of the individual practices surrounding it. You care about automated tests and code reviews, and when the build breaks, you don't run git blame. You find the root cause and fix it. You embrace the hard problems like localization, security, and timezones. You want to move our code, style and performance in the right direction and be an influencer.It doesn't matter if it's Ant or Gradle, Struts or Spring, jQuery or GWT - you know it or you can pick it up.

Skills & Requirements Things we like:    Prior experience with production large-scale distributed systems Familiarity with technologies we use (Java, Spring, GWT, Struts, JPA, EJB, REST)      A hunger for tracking down root causes - no matter how deep the rabbit hole       A BS in CS is appreciated but not necessary with the right background  What you'll do:  Be customer focused - learn about the business to help bring value to our customers Act technology driven - design, implement, and test new functionality    Work closely with QA - we fix our own bugs       Work with Product Management to deliver material value to our clients      Do full stack dev from the DB to the UI       Use your experience to help the whole team get better  What you'll get:           Market rate salary based on experience          An amazing on-boarding experience on Shareworks, Dev Culture, How we do things and even ""reforming"" you from .Net to Java           Participation in annual bonus plan and stock incentives   Share Purchase Plan with company contributions (we are public and profitable!)            Casual Environment - we aren’t a bank, they just happen to be clients 20 Paid Days off + 11 stat holidays (and 5 week sabbatical after 5 years) The occasional spontaneous Nerf War Relocation Assistance available for the right candidates  If you've read this far and you're thinking ""I want to be a part of this"", we agree!
