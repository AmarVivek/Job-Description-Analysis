You never overlook the saved instance state and have contemplated the tradeoffs between activities, fragments and views. You have knowledge of how a RESTful web service works, what makes it RESTful and how it can be accessed from Android. You are also diligent about meeting allocated budgets and can work within time constraints, but you will never sacrifice quality. What you’ll do:  Design, program and test software. Author and maintain relevant documentation for developers, clients and users. Develop and refine prototypes to confirm requirements. Program according to project plans (versions, sprints). Test according to pre-determined test plans. Support release and post-release activities, such as support, versioning and maintenance. Collaborate with our pencils (designers) to create interfaces that conform to the Google design guidelines. Peer review other team members’ code, and learn and adapt from peer review of your own code. Support sales and project managers with technical insights, leading to the creation of budgets and schedules for projects.  Desired skills and experience:  5+ years of delivering software with preference given to those who have a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or equivalent Solid understanding and practical knowledge of the full mobile development and application life cycle Solid understanding of Android UX/UI guidelines and best practices Experience with Android using Android Studio and JAVA Experience with a distributed Version Control System Experience with mobile development issues related to performance optimisation, caching and security Excellent communications skills with the ability to share insights and expectations with clients, stakeholders and colleagues, both locally and remotely  Work perks  Working alongside smart, talented people who will push you and help you grow. Support for professional development and access to as many books as you can read. A great work environment and health benefits. Fun activities (like book club and board game nights), biweekly Robo Brews and team parties.
