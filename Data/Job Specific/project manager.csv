You know that ""agile"" means adapting to deliver value to customers, not necessarily any of the individual practices surrounding it. You care about automated tests and code reviews, and when the build breaks, you don't run git blame. You find the root cause and fix it. You embrace the hard problems like localization, security, and timezones. You want to move our code, style and performance in the right direction and be an influencer.It doesn't matter if it's Ant or Gradle, Struts or Spring, jQuery or GWT - you know it or you can pick it up.

We also try to ensure there are plenty of occasions to have fun, relax, play, exercise, and build relationships. At Deloitte, we are redefining what it means to be a professional services firm.
