4749,Uber,backend developer,"&lt;strong&gt;About us&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; At Uber, we believe that by solving some of the biggest problems of our time, we can create a future where there is limitless freedom of movement for people and things all across the world. Just talk to our people — and feel their passion, optimism and curiosity for building solutions every single day on behalf of drivers, riders, couriers, eaters and employees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While these tough problems we face every day can be incredibly difficult to figure out, we believe those same problems enable us to personally grow the most. So we welcome people from all backgrounds who have the passion to change the world and also want to help create a supportive and collaborative environment. So that ultimately, we can learn together, solve together, build together, and move the world forward together. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For our drivers and couriers, the Uber app represents a flexible way to earn money. For cities and communities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer. And we’re thinking about the future, too with teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It’s tempting to want to join a company that looks like it has it all figured out&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; But those companies aren’t always the best place to learn. The truth is, the more problems a company has, the more opportunities there are to solve. And the more problems you solve, the more you learn. And the more you learn, the more you grow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We need your skills and passion to help make it happen!

From building maps that help move millions of people, to the messaging systems that let us interact with them - the work you do will impact every single Uber request. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Expertise in one or more object oriented programming language (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++) and the eagerness to learn more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with developing complex software systems scaling to millions of users with production quality deployment, monitoring and reliability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with large-scale distributed storage and database systems (SQL or NoSQL, e.g. MySQL, Cassandra)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to decompose complex business problems and lead a team in solving them&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Bonus points if&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science or a related field&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Team-specific focus areas&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Additionally, Uber has a variety of roles and teams for you depending on where your interests match best. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;High performance systems - Experience with building high performance distributed systems that can scale to 100,000s QPS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core Infrastructure - Experience with developing and running large scale distributed storage systems, service oriented architectures, and reliable monitoring and deployment infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data Processing - experience with building and maintaining large scale and/or real-time complex data processing pipelines using Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Storm, and Zookeeper&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning - experience with machine learning, information retrieval, algorithmic complexity, data mining, pricing, optimization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Geospatial - Familiarity with geospatial datasets and services, such as maps, local search, points of interest and business listings data, mobile device location and GPS traces.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; #SO-post",https://www.glassdoor.ca/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=110&ao=352430&s=58&guid=0000016393783b5daea7f3939a5421a7&src=GD_JOB_AD&vt=w&rtp=0&cs=1_eef63ce3&cb=1527187520701&jobListingId=2776977340,Toronto,,Software Engineer - Backend,9

Users can search, compare and buy tickets from hundreds of bus companies in over 16,000 cities and more than 1M different bus routes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We&#039;re working hard to make the bus, one of the most environmentally friendly and sustainable modes of transportation, a great travel option for customers in dozens of languages in over 60 different countries. Our platform unites travelers, partners and bus companies throughout the world to move an increasingly large share of the entire industry online to increase access and improve the travel experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our people, technology, and approach have been instrumental in getting us this far, but we have so much more to do, and that&#039;s where you come in. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What do we expect from you?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Busbud is looking for a Senior and Intermediate Backend Developer with a diversified experience to join our team of talented developers. Our challenges evolve, and as a data and API specialist, you&#039;ll have the greatest impact on the systems and platforms that support our customers, our partners, our products and our team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Your initial focus will be to build fast, highly available, and easy to consume Javascript applications to bring the right data to customers of Busbud and have them successfully purchase their bus travel. You&#039;ll balance iteration and prototyping with risk-taking and greenfielding. You&#039;ll routinely work with modern tools like Node, Redis, Postgres and RabbitMQ (you&#039;ll use a few others for internal tools too). You&#039;ll share your wisdom with a team that values learning and experimenting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Depending on the task, you may own the feature end to end, or work with other team members to bring it to life together. We expect you to feel at home on the server modeling data, in the profiler improving performance, in documentation explaining how to use your fine work and everywhere in between. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Given Busbud&#039;s all javascript stack (with some Typescript making an appearance), and depending on your interests, you&#039;ll also have the opportunity to work on preventing fraud, improving how we communicate with customers, how we interface with supplier systems, upgrading our global architecture, monitoring, and much more. We&#039;ve got lots of challenges from which to choose! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How can you impress us?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You might recognize a few of these from Camille Fournier&#039;s RTR post, which we&#039;ve used to build our own career path ladder. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As an Intermediate or Senior developer, you  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Have shaped broad architecture, having shipped multiple large services, complex libraries or major pieces of infrastructure (5+ years)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Are sought out for technical guidance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Are recognized as a prolific contributor to core and side projects&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Love what you do, and sweat the details&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You&#039;re comfortable with (or can quickly ramp up) with some key ingredients in our tech stack: Javascript, NodeJS, React, Redis, Postgres, CDNs and caches, REST APIs and Heroku&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; At Busbud, you will  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be an owner and expert on large sections of our codebase, initially the website and related services&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Anticipate technical issues at the product level and make architectural and design decisions to avoid them&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Exemplify software development excellence balancing scope and deadlines to deliver on quality and speed with appropriate test coverage, monitoring and rollout plans&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Multiply the effectiveness of peers by facilitating cross-team work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Make our pages and site fast, beautiful, accessible and great for our users&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Delight Google and other search engines with your thoughtful use of sitemaps, interlinking, annotated content and other tactics to help travelers find buses.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Whats in it for you?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Compensation based on experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;4 weeks of vacation (3 weeks + holiday season)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Health Benefits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stock options&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Apple equipment&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Breakfast snacks, team lunch on Wednesdays, happy hour on Fridays&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Team events&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A beautiful office in Montreals burgeoning tech neighbourhood, Mile End&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What&#039;s it like working as a Developer at Busbud?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;You get the tools you need to be successful: laptop, big screen, comfy chair and desk and whatever else you might need to do your best work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We invest in our tool chain so you can focus on building: we&#039;ve got instrumentation, monitoring, logging, continuous integration, continuous deployments, crowd testing, managed translations and much more. And since we use Javascript in almost all our projects, it&#039;s easy for anyone to jump across projects, provide a code review or contribute.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We love our office and having most of the team there for high-bandwidth face-to-face communication, and we also have flexible work schedules and support for remote work in our DNA - Mike, our CTO, had spent most of his time in Busbud&#039;s early days working remotely out of New York using chat, Github and other async tools to great success in addition to Google Hangouts for 1-on-1s, and also larger team meetings. Our A/V setup isn&#039;t perfect (yet!), but it&#039;s gotten pretty good :)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Many of us have kids, others hobbies, and sometimes both, so we encourage a sane work/life balance. If you want to work like crazy, we&#039;ll take that too - you&#039;ll be in good company with the team&#039;s night owls&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We use science (A/B tests) and customer feedback (interviews, support, live chat) to determine the impact of our work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We serve over 10M bus departures daily through our API, website and apps, and we&#039;re constantly looking for ways to improve our performance and availability without overwhelming the bus companies that supply us with the data - there are lots of challenges in this area around failure mitigation, latency compensation, cache optimization and much more&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We help travelers in over 60 countries, so we have all kinds of competitors keeping us on our toes, and we need to find ways of providing value to our users to keep them coming back to Busbud to find and buy what is essentially a commodity product. This is a constant challenge which we meet with creativity and taking risks.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;As much as we can, we deploy explicit and intentional effort to improve diversity in tech and also help upskill the next generation of developers through internship programs, mentoring and hosting, organizing or sponsoring relevant events.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There&#039;s a lot more, and if you&#039;re still reading, then you should hop over to the blog and our tech blog.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;em&gt;&#034;Busbud is committed to equal employment opportunity for all employees and to providing its team members with a work environment free from discrimination and harassment.

4817,BenchSci,backend developer,"You&#039;ve read job posts that promise you&#039;ll change the world. Then you discover they&#039;re for yet another social media app, marketing agency, or consulting firm. You click away. And you wonder: &#034;Aren&#039;t there opportunities where I can make a big impact? While I earn recognition and rewards for my efforts? And get to work with exceptional people on exciting new technology?&#034; If that sounds like you, meet BenchSci. You will be a great fit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About us&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We use machine learning to accelerate drug discovery by helping scientists execute successful experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We focus on a huge problem in drug discovery&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Each year, biomedical researchers waste over a billion combined hours. The problem is with products they purchase to influence and measure proteins. There are millions of them, from hundreds of vendors. Finding the right products for specific experiments is tough. Researchers spend hours and sometimes days searching through published papers for guidance. But even then, many products they buy don&#039;t work. Some aren&#039;t right for a specific experiment. Others are poor quality. This delays scientific discoveries by weeks or months. And it slows availability of breakthrough treatments, while making them more expensive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We apply artificial intelligence to solve it&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thanks to improvements in machine learning, we can now solve this problem. We spent more than two years teaching a computer to read science papers like a human scientist. It decodes the information, which we present to researchers in an easy-to-use, web-based platform. They can then find products for experiments in minutes, not days, and see data that builds trust. The time and money they save has led to rapid adoption by top pharmaceutical companies and hundreds of academic institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Product video&lt;/strong&gt;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPs5xzYYHSs &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If our story excites you, let us describe who we would love on our team.

Then you discover they&#039;re for yet another social media app, marketing agency, or consulting firm. You click away. And you wonder: &#034;Aren&#039;t there opportunities where I can make a big impact? While I earn recognition and rewards for my efforts? And get to work with exceptional people on exciting new technology?&#034; If that sounds like you, meet BenchSci. You will be a great fit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About us&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We use machine learning to accelerate drug discovery by helping scientists execute successful experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We focus on a huge problem in drug discovery&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Each year, biomedical researchers waste over a billion combined hours. The problem is with products they purchase to influence and measure proteins. There are millions of them, from hundreds of vendors. Finding the right products for specific experiments is tough. Researchers spend hours and sometimes days searching through published papers for guidance. But even then, many products they buy don&#039;t work. Some aren&#039;t right for a specific experiment. Others are poor quality. This delays scientific discoveries by weeks or months. And it slows availability of breakthrough treatments, while making them more expensive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We apply artificial intelligence to solve it&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thanks to improvements in machine learning, we can now solve this problem. We spent more than two years teaching a computer to read science papers like a human scientist. It decodes the information, which we present to researchers in an easy-to-use, web-based platform. They can then find products for experiments in minutes, not days, and see data that builds trust. The time and money they save has led to rapid adoption by top pharmaceutical companies and hundreds of academic institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Product video&lt;/strong&gt;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPs5xzYYHSs &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If our story excites you, let us describe who we would love on our team.

4837,Shopify,backend developer,"About the role&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;div&gt;Shopify is the world’s fastest growing commerce platform, with no plans to slow down. We’re on a mission to scale our platform while simultaneously improving performance, reliability, and resiliency. To do this, we need the help of dedicated, methodical, and versatile developers! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We’re looking for senior back-end and full stack developers with a passion for solving tough problems with performant code. We ship on quality instead of on time. Our teams deploy new code many times a day, and our production scale is massive. We’re talking hundreds of thousands of online stores, and hundreds of millions of requests a day. Thousands of merchants will see your work within seconds – a tough but incredibly rewarding responsibility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We’re growing quickly, so there are plenty of opportunities to learn and advance. You’ll have the creative freedom to make a real difference in the world of commerce, the support to bring your whole self to work, and the chance to work with the best in the business. We&#039;ve listed some of our team who are looking to grow - take a look and if any of these teams seem particularly interesting, we&#039;d love to hear from you! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Channels, Online Store&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; People want to buy wherever they are and however they want. Checkout is part of it all: online, on mobile, in-store, on marketplaces, on social media, and in VR/AR. During the Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend, $1 billion of GMV went through our platform with a peak of $1 million of orders processed per minute. Our limits are constantly being pushed. This is a role where you can think big! What is the future of checkout? How can Shopify build the best buying experiences on the planet (and beyond)? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Core&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Core is at the very heart of Shopify, and at the heart of our merchants&#039; businesses as well. We create tools that give even the most inexperienced entrepreneur the best chance to succeed, and at the same time, we design products that help some of the world’s leading businesses manage enormous complexity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our Core team enables merchants to carry out day to day tasks like adding new products, managing inventory, fulfilling orders and more using the Shopify web admin as the central place to run their business. We also provide insights on their products and customers to let them maximize the impact of their store and free up time to focus on the things they really love doing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Core is the foundation on which all other Shopify teams are able to build, and we set standards to ensure that they can do it thoughtfully and seamlessly using tools like our design system, Polaris. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Internationalization&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We want to make commerce better for everyone, everywhere. Countries differ in many ways in term of language, culture, and how people engage with commerce. We want to embrace these differences and make sure Shopify is the right platform for all merchants. Our small team has already experimented with different approaches in India and Japan, and we’re now ready to apply those learnings to more international markets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our focus towards markets we haven&#039;t explored will have important repercussions on how we, developers, build things, but also how we think about new features and projects.As a member of this team, your responsibilities will be to make sure we do this in a sane, sustainable, reusable way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Money&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Shopify Money team is responsible for all systems that move money between Shopify, our merchants and their buyers, and Shopify Partners. This includes payment processing, billing, capital advances, account balances and evaluating risk. Issues that involve money can seem complicated and even scary. The goal of the entire team is to demystify this process, and make all our financial processes simpler and friendlier to use.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; You’ll need to have extensive experience with:&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;div&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Building backend web services using several languages and frameworks (some tools we use include Ruby, UNIX commands, Go, Kafka, Python, …)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with relational databases and SQL (we’re mostly on MySQL with some Postgres)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with Rails or the desire to learn it quickly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building and scaling user-focused web applications and/or mobile applications using different technologies (React, Angular, Backbone, Bootstrap, Swift, Android, …)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; It’d be amazing if you have:&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;div&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;A history of contributing to our community through code, documentation, mentoring, teaching, speaking, or organizing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience building resilient, scalable services and concepts like SLA, fault tolerance, circuit breakers ring a bell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with development on a leading cloud provider (GCE, AWS, Azure, …)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A commitment and drive for quality, excellence and results&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A passion for helping growing development teams and making others better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We know that applying to a new role takes a lot of work and we truly value your time.

We currently take two 3-day retreats for mission setting, aligning with our goals, product management and team building. We usually do a spring and fall one up at a cottage. Were not saying this involves a beer keg, guitars and campfires. But were not saying it doesnt. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We are managing our growth. We continue to promote and nurture the open, collaborative nature of who we are and how we work. And we dont just support each other in the office. The number of musicians in-house is pretty overwhelming, from big band trumpeters to death metal guitarists. Theres always a co-worker with a gig coming up and we go out to cheer them on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If being a pioneer in the world of data and solving real-world problems sounds like a future you want to be part of, express your interest here or follow us on Twitter or LinkedIn to learn more about us. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; ThinkData Works welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities.

Users can search, compare and buy tickets from hundreds of bus companies in over 16,000 cities and more than 1M different bus routes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We&#039;re working hard to make the bus, one of the most environmentally friendly and sustainable modes of transportation, a great travel option for customers in dozens of languages in over 60 different countries. Our platform unites travelers, partners and bus companies throughout the world to move an increasingly large share of the entire industry online to increase access and improve the travel experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our people, technology and approach have been instrumental in getting us this far, but we have so much more to do, and that&#039;s where you come in. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What do we expect from you?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Busbud is looking for a &lt;strong&gt;senior Developer&lt;/strong&gt; with a diversified experience to join our team of talented developers.

You&#039;ll balance iteration and A/B testing with risk-taking and greenfielding. You&#039;ll routinely work with modern tools like React, Node and SASS on the frontend, and Node, Redis and Postgres on the backend. You&#039;ll share your wisdom with a team that values learning and experimenting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Depending on the task, you may own the feature end to end, or work with other team members to bring it to life together. We expect you to feel at home on the frontend in user experience land as much as on the backend modeling data and everywhere in between. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As a full stack developer, and depending on your interests, you&#039;ll also have the opportunity to work on preventing fraud, improving how we communicate with customers, how we interface with supplier systems, upgrading our global architecture, monitoring, and much more.

And since we use Javascript in almost all our projects, it&#039;s easy for anyone to jump across projects, provide a code review or contribute.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We love our office and having most of the team there for high-bandwidth face-to-face communication, and we also have flexible work schedules and support for remote work in our DNA - Mike, our CTO, had spent most of his time in Busbud&#039;s early days working remotely out of New York using chat, Github and other async tools to great success in addition to Google Hangouts for 1-on-1s, and also larger team meetings. Our A/V setup isn&#039;t perfect (yet!), but it&#039;s gotten pretty good :)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Many of us have kids, others hobbies, and sometimes both, so we encourage a sane work/life balance. If you want to work like crazy, we&#039;ll take that too - you&#039;ll be in good company with the team&#039;s night owls&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;We use science (A/B tests) and customer feedback (interviews, support, live chat) to determine the impact of our work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We serve over 10M bus departures daily through our API, website and apps, and we&#039;re constantly looking for ways to improve our performance and availability without overwhelming the bus companies that supply us with the data - there are lots of challenges in this area around failure mitigation, latency compensation, cache optimization and much more&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We help travelers in over 60 countries, so we have all kinds of competitors keeping us on our toes, and we need to find ways of providing value to our users to keep them coming back to Busbud to find and buy what is essentially a commodity product. This is a constant challenge which we meet with creativity and taking risks. As much as we can, we deploy explicit and intentional effort to improve diversity in tech and also help upskill the next generation of developers through internship programs, mentoring and hosting, organizing or sponsoring relevant events.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There&#039;s a lot more, and if you&#039;re still reading, then you should hop over to the blog and our tech blog.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;em&gt;Busbud is committed to equal employment opportunity for all employees and to providing its team members with a work environment free from discrimination and harassment.

Fleet operators and public transit agencies in North America and Asia use RideCo’s cloud based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses, vans and cars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Have you experienced getting frustrated with public buses and switched to driving a car? What about dynamically splitting the cost of a taxi ride with others going the same way? Have you seen buses drive around in residential areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You’re likely aware of the first &amp; last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This ‘dynamic shuttle’ (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo’s ‘dynamic shuttle’ platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While there are many companies attempting to commercialize dynamic transportation solutions, RideCo is the only company that offers a solution that works in real-time at large scale across a mixed fleet of vehicles from buses to sedans in both high-density and low-density urban environments. This unique solution is based on patent-pending logistics technology developed over years of research by our engineering team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; RideCo’s early adopter customers include regional transit agencies as well as multi-national private fleet operators in North America and Asia. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Compensation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Negotiable base salary + shares/stock options &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Contact&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Send your resume (or link to your LinkedIn profile) and cover letter to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;resume@rideco.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Email Subject: “Quality Assurance (QA) Developer&lt;/strong&gt;",https://www.glassdoor.ca/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=1325&ao=7438&s=58&guid=0000016393794c8ca2bb0ed8cdff9d22&src=GD_JOB_AD&vt=w&rtp=0&cs=1_8691dc0b&cb=1527187590688&jobListingId=2769913603,Waterloo,,Software Engineer - QA Developer,349

Our platform unites travelers, partners and bus companies throughout the world to move an increasingly large share of the entire industry online to increase access and improve the travel experience.

Busbud is looking for a Senior and Intermediate Backend Developer with a diversified experience to join our team of talented developers. Our challenges evolve, and as a data and API specialist, you'll have the greatest impact on the systems and platforms that support our customers, our partners, our products and our team. Your initial focus will be to build fast, highly available, and easy to consume Javascript applications to bring the right data to customers of Busbud and have them successfully purchase their bus travel. You'll balance iteration and prototyping with risk-taking and greenfielding. You'll routinely work with modern tools like Node, Redis, Postgres and RabbitMQ (you'll use a few others for internal tools too). You'll share your wisdom with a team that values learning and experimenting. Depending on the task, you may own the feature end to end, or work with other team members to bring it to life together.

Given Busbud's all javascript stack (with some Typescript making an appearance), and depending on your interests, you'll also have the opportunity to work on preventing fraud, improving how we communicate with customers, how we interface with supplier systems, upgrading our global architecture, monitoring, and much more.

A Front-end Developer's role focuses on the UI and UX of web products and applications and integrating them with backend systems and APIs. You should be equipped with an ever-shifting tool belt based on latest best practices, up-to-date standards, and most importantly a strong understanding of the problem at hand and what best solves it.  Worried about frameworks, build systems, transpilers and other beasts? Don't be.

You have a foundational understanding of modern patterns and methodologies, a solid grasp of latest specifications, and an awareness of accessibility and performance pitfalls. You are flexible and strive to better yourself and the company. You have a collaborative mindset, and most importantly, you have empathy for your users, clients, and co-workers.  'Front-end' is a broad term and doesn't have to be all-encompassing, if you feel like you fit some of the following you should get in touch: You have worked with a designer or solo to build out a styleguide/style system/UI kit. You have rolled your own BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS-esque css architecture, for better or worse. You have built a SPA or two using one or more JS frameworks and it went really well. You have built a SPA or two using one or more JS frameworks and it went really badly. You've built out a website or web-app that met WCAG AA compliance.

We consider ourselves a laid back bunch, but driven to do well for our customers. We’re looking for low egos, and high skills. You can be young and inexperienced or a savvy veteran, what we’re really looking for is your ability to code, which may be finely honed skill or raw talent at this point. We aren't looking to stick you in a corner with headphones on and call you “the IT department”. Developers own this joint; we get it. If you’re desperate to break free from that office life where you co-workers have never even heard of Minecraft, and want to come on board to build kick-ass commerce sites, corporate gems, and the occasional game, keep reading. As the successful candidate, here's some things you’ll be responsible for: ***Must have Drupal Experience and be able to provide example work*** Producing high quality work adhering to Acro Media standards and following the Acro Media production process Implementing updates & revisions to web sites Contributing code back to the Drupal community, testing and responding to issues, maintaining modules. Working independently on multiple smaller tasks or larger builds with shifting priorities and tight deadlines Adhering to and providing accurate estimates for the amount of time required to repair a defect, a build, or to add additional functionality to an existing application Providing efficient solutions in a timely manner for work requests, issues, and defects Communicating well with Account Managers, Supervisors, and Clients in regards to work requests, problems and defects Acting as both a peer/mentor to other Developers as well as be comfortable asking for help from team members The successful applicant will have: Ability to find and fix problems in code, this might not be your code and your only hint might be a cryptic complaint from a client. A good mix of web development skills, you should be able to build out site template and then code all the gears and pulleys behind the scenes as well, we try not to have people who do all HTML/CSS and people who do all backend coding, we like people who can multi-class. You’re not going to work on the same thing for 8 months. If you only have experience on embedded systems or just design sexy layouts, maybe try to brush up on your weaker areas, we are open minded though so don’t let this scare you away. Our designers use Photoshop, so when you’re building out the templates, it’s good to know how to navigate around this application. Basic knowledge of how layers work, and the use of some the more important tools that are required for taking apart the design and deriving all the images for web-use is a plus. We're open to good programmers who know other languages and technologies and are will to learn, but below is a list of a bunch of stuff we normally work with: Has Drupal work to send us PHP SQL CSS3/HTML5 Javascript/jQuery XML Bonus: C++/Objective C/C#/C If you know other languages don’t forget to mention them, if you are a badass Lisp hacker type, mention that. Comfortable working in a Linux shell to do day-to-day tasks. Hopefully, you have installed Linux on something at least once, even if it was just your Xbox, phone...or vacuum etc. (For real, though, you can get Linux installed on a Roomba) Some understanding of Linux hosting if at all possible. Have you configured your own server? Did you setup a web server for your house or friends, even if no one else really cared? Prior experience with a source control system (ex, SVN, Git, GitHub, etc.) Formal education or prior experience is NOT required, we just want to know that you can code, so you’ll have to have some work you can show us. Here are some things we pride ourselves on being able to offer our staff: Flex start times & Earned days off: Do you prefer to start at 8:00? or 9:00? We'll work with you. Want every second Friday off? Well we've got a program for that too! Paid Overtime for all roles...including salary positions: What? What?! Yep you heard right. We pay for all approved OT...not that we want everyone working so hard, but with the natural ebb and flow of our industry sometimes it's needed to blast out the OT in order to keep our heads above water. We find this little pay cheque nugget is a nice reward for the over timerz. Slappies: Tougher to explain but once a month we get together and have a little ceremony, some food, a few brews - no altars or corporate chants involved. Fun day: We aim to have fun every day; however, every year for a day we cram a bunch of fun on ourselves. Weee! SPARC Events: Sometimes we have an in-house breakfast, team building events, (less corny than it sounds), competitions, or just a plain little reward for no reason. It's a little spark in our usually normal days. Warning, we make you wear costumes. Often. Culture: We're a certain type of people. We're all a little different and unique in our own way but we seem to work well together. No one’s perfect and we embrace that. We take our work seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously.

You can be young and inexperienced or a savvy veteran, what we’re really looking for is your ability to code, which may be finely honed skill or raw talent at this point. We aren't looking to stick you in a corner with headphones on and call you “the IT department”. Developers own this joint; we get it.

You’re not going to work on the same thing for 8 months. If you only have experience on embedded systems or just design sexy layouts, maybe try to brush up on your weaker areas, we are open minded though so don’t let this scare you away. Our designers use Photoshop, so when you’re building out the templates, it’s good to know how to navigate around this application. Basic knowledge of how layers work, and the use of some the more important tools that are required for taking apart the design and deriving all the images for web-use is a plus.

Have you configured your own server? Did you setup a web server for your house or friends, even if no one else really cared? Prior experience with a source control system (ex, SVN, Git, GitHub, etc.) Formal education or prior experience is NOT required, we just want to know that you can code, so you’ll have to have some work you can show us. Here are some things we pride ourselves on being able to offer our staff: Flex start times & Earned days off: Do you prefer to start at 8:00? or 9:00? We'll work with you. Want every second Friday off? Well we've got a program for that too! Paid Overtime for all roles...including salary positions: What? What?! Yep you heard right. We pay for all approved OT...not that we want everyone working so hard, but with the natural ebb and flow of our industry sometimes it's needed to blast out the OT in order to keep our heads above water. We find this little pay cheque nugget is a nice reward for the over timerz. Slappies: Tougher to explain but once a month we get together and have a little ceremony, some food, a few brews - no altars or corporate chants involved. Fun day: We aim to have fun every day; however, every year for a day we cram a bunch of fun on ourselves. Weee! SPARC Events: Sometimes we have an in-house breakfast, team building events, (less corny than it sounds), competitions, or just a plain little reward for no reason.

We consider ourselves a laid back bunch, but driven to do well for our customers. We’re looking for low egos, and high skills. You can be young and inexperienced or a savvy veteran, what we’re really looking for is your ability to code, which may be finely honed skill or raw talent at this point. We aren't looking to stick you in a corner with headphones on and call you “the IT department”. Developers own this joint; we get it. If you’re desperate to break free from that office life where you co-workers have never even heard of Minecraft, and want to come on board to build kick-ass commerce sites, corporate gems, and the occasional game, keep reading.

A good mix of web development skills, you should be able to build out site template and then code all the gears and pulleys behind the scenes as well, we try not to have people who do all HTML/CSS and people who do all backend coding, we like people who can multi-class. You’re not going to work on the same thing for 8 months. If you only have experience on embedded systems or just design sexy layouts, maybe try to brush up on your weaker areas, we are open minded though so don’t let this scare you away. Our designers use Photoshop, so when you’re building out the templates, it’s good to know how to navigate around this application. Basic knowledge of how layers work, and the use of some the more important tools that are required for taking apart the design and deriving all the images for web-use is a plus. We're open to good programmers who know other languages and technologies and are will to learn, but below is a list of a bunch of stuff we normally work with: Has Drupal work to send us PHP SQL CSS3/HTML5 Javascript/jQuery XML Bonus: C++/Objective C/C#/C If you know other languages don’t forget to mention them, if you are a badass Lisp hacker type, mention that. Comfortable working in a Linux shell to do day-to-day tasks. Hopefully, you have installed Linux on something at least once, even if it was just your Xbox, phone...or vacuum etc. (For real, though, you can get Linux installed on a Roomba) Some understanding of Linux hosting if at all possible. Have you configured your own server? Did you setup a web server for your house or friends, even if no one else really cared? Prior experience with a source control system (ex, SVN, Git, GitHub, etc.) Formal education or prior experience is NOT required, we just want to know that you can code, so you’ll have to have some work you can show us. Here are some things we pride ourselves on being able to offer our staff: Flex start times & Earned days off: Do you prefer to start at 8:00? or 9:00? We'll work with you. Want every second Friday off? Well we've got a program for that too! Paid Overtime for all roles...including salary positions: What? What?! Yep you heard right. We pay for all approved OT...not that we want everyone working so hard, but with the natural ebb and flow of our industry sometimes it's needed to blast out the OT in order to keep our heads above water. We find this little pay cheque nugget is a nice reward for the over timerz. Slappies: Tougher to explain but once a month we get together and have a little ceremony, some food, a few brews - no altars or corporate chants involved. Fun day: We aim to have fun every day; however, every year for a day we cram a bunch of fun on ourselves. Weee! SPARC Events: Sometimes we have an in-house breakfast, team building events, (less corny than it sounds), competitions, or just a plain little reward for no reason. It's a little spark in our usually normal days. Warning, we make you wear costumes. Often. Culture: We're a certain type of people.

10465,    Electric Edge Systems Group Inc.,backend developer,"Electric Edge Systems Group Inc.FACTS™ - Fishing Activity & Catch Tracking SystemIntermediate to Senior Systems DeveloperMonday to Friday 8:00-4:00 pm (possibility of an earlier start/end time)A Bit About How Us and How We Are Changing Fisheries ITWe started back I 2001 with Fisheries and Oceans Canada (aka DFO) and the National Recreational Licensing System. That was back when we did contract systems work for just about any client and did that kind of work with the DFO up until about 2014. In 2009 we realized that we had been working in fisheries in BC that the rest of the world dreamed they could operate because of how they are monitored. We saw that having all of that monitoring data being submitted via paper forms and then data entered was quite frankly crazy in the 21st century.That’s when we started building what we hope will be considered the best fisheries IT product on the planet to drag the entire industry out of the dark ages of IT and towards a better way. FACTS™ (Fishing Activity & Catch Tracking System) was launched in 2010 and we haven’t looked back. It’s tough being a maverick, but we saw the vision and strove to prove it was the way of the future. We didn’t do it by going public, making fantastical claims, or saying we “could” do it – we just built it and proved it works. We like to think our clients would back us up on that statement…oh wait they have!Fast forward to 2014 when fisheries in the US started to talk about systems using the approach we do (one might wonder where they got the idea). We were ready for them having proven ourselves by doing – now we are considered experts. So much so, that in 2015 we were asked by The Office of Science and Technology (part of NOAA in the US) to visit all six federal fisheries regions and document how they collect fishing data and how that data is handled and where it ends up. Once assessed we were to provide ways for each region to modernize their data collection and management systems.Now we jump to today where we handle the fisheries of two US states, provide various modules of FACTS™ to several industry groups, and are involved in several projects based on grants won by folks we work with. The phones are ringing, we are done with any sort of stealth mode and we are looking for an outstanding new team member to join our team. Will that be you?See www.fisheryfacts.com for more information about our outstanding product (new site close to launching).Our Clients Who Love Us and We Love BECAUSE they are AwesomeClients can make or break your day and ours are simply awesome – smart folks trying to do their best to protect fish resources and/or harvest responsibly. They are always great to work with, which is rather handy as we either are their IT team or a great addition to their existing IT team.FACTS™ is a SaaS offering and for the fee, we simply do what is needed. This means we work very closely with our clients every day and are enhancing the system all the time. We don’t wait for long upgrade cycles – if something isn’t as good as it could be, or something changes in a fishery that requires the system to be adjusted – we do it. This makes for a fresh system with little room for “making due” for end users. They see the results of their feedback far faster than a system that follows the normal SDLC. That makes for happy users, happy clients, and excellent referrals to new clients.What You’ll Do Besides Building The Best Fisheries IT System EverThe Intermediate to Senior Systems Developer reports to and works closely with the CEO, Lead Senior Systems Developer, and the Customer and Systems Support Specialist.The primary responsibility of the role will be to learn the database structure and the system as a whole. The successful candidate will be provided ample training and support from our team. Initially work will be a support role which will include daily issue resolution and non-mission critical system changes and enhancements. You will learn our system through helping with the testing of issues that need resolution. That will be coupled with access to the Lead Senior Systems Developer and the CEO to help explain the system, how it functions, and what the most important aspects and rules are within it.As you advance in your training your work will also include larger and more critical issues/changes, and self-serve support tools for the company and clients. A big part of being a systems developer at Electric Edge Systems Group is staying current with the rules in each fishery/module combinations that the client(s) you work with are using.You will provide prompt and courteous internal support for our FACTS™ Customer and Systems Support Specialist via e-mail, in person, by phone, and a systems issue ticketing application (Jira from Atlassian).This position requires the applicant to work diligently, independently with the ability to recognize when they need more information when making a judgment call. Accuracy, with the ability to listen attentively and attention to detail are all key aspects of this position.Hats to be WornWe are a small, but growing company. That means we all wear multiple hats, but we also get to define our future – how fun is that!Ideas – we always like new ideas. We know we don’t know it all and so should you.

We're working hard to make the bus, one of the most environmentally friendly and sustainable modes of transportation, a great travel option for customers in dozens of languages in over 60 different countries. Our platform unites travelers, partners and bus companies throughout the world to move an increasingly large share of the entire industry online to increase access and improve the travel experience. Our people, technology and approach have been instrumental in getting us this far, but we have so much more to do, and that's where you come in. What do we expect from you? Busbud is looking for a senior Developer with a diversified experience to join our team of talented developers. Our challenges evolve, and as a generalist, you'll have the greatest impact on the team and our customers. Your initial focus will be to build fast, rich Javascript applications and style beautiful pages to bring the right users to Busbud and have them successfully purchase their bus travel. You'll balance iteration and A/B testing with risk-taking and greenfielding. You'll routinely work with modern tools like React, Node and SASS on the frontend, and Node, Redis and Postgres on the backend. You'll share your wisdom with a team that values learning and experimenting. Depending on the task, you may own the feature end to end, or work with other team members to bring it to life together. We expect you to feel at home on the frontend in user experience land as much as on the backend modeling data and everywhere in between. As a full stack developer, and depending on your interests, you'll also have the opportunity to work on preventing fraud, improving how we communicate with customers, how we interface with supplier systems, upgrading our global architecture, monitoring, and much more. We've got lots of challenges from which to choose! How can you impress us? You might recognize a few of these from Camille Fournier's RTR post, which we've used to build our own career path ladder.

We love our office and having most of the team there for high-bandwidth face-to-face communication, and we also have flexible work schedules and support for remote work in our DNA - Mike, our CTO, had spent most of his time in Busbud's early days working remotely out of New York using chat, Github and other async tools to great success in addition to Google Hangouts for 1-on-1s, and also larger team meetings.

This is a constant challenge which we meet with creativity and taking risks. As much as we can, we deploy explicit and intentional effort to improve diversity in tech and also help upskill the next generation of developers through internship programs, mentoring and hosting, organizing or sponsoring relevant events.
