579,"    41 Service Battalion, 14 Service Company",electrical engineer,"Job SummaryYou need work. You need more income. You want to be challenged. You want to see value in your work. Why not join the Canadian Armed Forces Army Reserves?I don’t like people telling me what to do.Regardless of how high up you are in an organization, there is always somebody telling you what to do. It may be a supervisor, manager, company policy, provincial/federal regulation, law, etc. The list is endless. “To be a good Leader, you need to be a good Follower.” The Leader leads by following the various rules that have been established. Once you receive the various levels of Trades training and Leadership training, it will be you that is ensuring that the soldiers that you are responsible for are following the rules accordingly as well.I couldn’t take somebody yelling in my face.Most jobs will result in somebody increasing their volume to cease an unsafe act especially if life or limbs are in danger. Being loud and being heard is a typical military environment when necessary but is not a day-to-day, all day-long means of communication.The pay isn’t enough.As is with any new job, the pay is proportional to your amount of experience and Rank. The more Trade and Leadership Courses that you complete, the more likely that you will be promoted and provided with additional responsibilities and expectations. As you increase your experience and rank, you will receive additional pay. The Reserves are meant to be an income in addition to your regular Monday to Friday job and often the income is used by students to offset tuition and living expenses throughout their education. There are also Dental Benefits, Provincial Health Care Premium reimbursements, Education Allowances, no cost accommodations & meal allowances, field pay, temporary duty allowances and more.I don’t want to go to war.The Canadian Armed Forces are a voluntary organization meaning that you are not forced to serve. As a Reservist, you will not be relocated (posted) to another province or city and you will not be deployed (domestically or internationally). To be involved with a Domestic Operation, you would participate according to your availability (civilian employment, family commitments, etc.). To participate in an international operation (UN, NATO and Humanitarian Relief), you would apply for a position and be screened for compatibility. If you meet the criteria, you would receive training and be deployed accordingly.Why join at all?Every Applicant has their own reason for joining the Canadian Armed Forces Army, Navy (RCN) and Air Force (RCAF) Regular Forces or Reserve Forces. Some may be simple like needing a second income or to throw hand grenades. Some may be more detailed like to receive free Trades Training (Vehicle Technician, Cook, Mobile Support Equipment Operator, etc.) that can be used toward your education or full-time income. Maybe an Uncle or Father or Grandma served in uniform at some period and you would like to share that experience or to experience a military deployment in a far away country. There are a multitude of reasons but you need to find your own. Besides the income & benefits, besides the comradery & friends you will make, besides the training & experience, many join the Armed Forces to be a part of a very large and proud community that has been serving to protect Canada and her interests for over 100 years. To represent Canada in uniform is not something that can be described. It needs to be experienced.In reality, the Canadian Armed Forces Primary Reserves is an organization that will train and push you beyond the limits that you are used to or comfortable with. It is not like what you see on TV or in the movies. Your body and mind will naturally resist but a large portion of the training is to help you adapt and adjust to the new challenges. The Basic Training Course is developed for you to succeed but you have to want to be successful.

Do you want to work with a system that gets a half million logins from one hundred thousand users per month? How about write code for an industry-leading financial services platform that transacts more than ten billion dollars a year? Do you think it would be cool to be a part of the team that expands this platform to transact one trillion dollars for ten million users?  Have you ever wanted to be in a Guild?  Have you yearned to hear ""that sounds great go ahead and try it out""?You aren't dogmatic; you're pragmatic. You know that ""agile"" means adapting to deliver value to customers, not necessarily any of the individual practices surrounding it. You care about automated tests and code reviews, and when the build breaks, you don't run git blame. You find the root cause and fix it. You embrace the hard problems like localization, security, and timezones. You want to move our code, style and performance in the right direction and be an influencer.It doesn't matter if it's Ant or Gradle, Struts or Spring, jQuery or GWT - you know it or you can pick it up. You aim to build commercial products that people use - technology is just a means to an end. We are looking for developers of all experience levels to help us build a fast, reliable, secure, and resilient enterprise platform on a global scale.Things we believe:  Results matter, not the clock.     Code and technology are what we use to solve problems, not the whole of our job. Continuously Improving, learning everyday through pairing, Lunch and Learns and mentorship.      You are passionate about about what you do and you take pride in your craft. Great programmers are great programmers whether they work in Java, .Net, React Native or C++ Free tools are great unless they aren't the best. We use high-end Linux workstations with big monitors and tools like IDEA, JRebel and the Atlassian suite to keep us in the zone.  Skills & Requirements Things we like:    Prior experience with production large-scale distributed systems Familiarity with technologies we use (Java, Spring, GWT, Struts, JPA, EJB, REST)      A hunger for tracking down root causes - no matter how deep the rabbit hole       A BS in CS is appreciated but not necessary with the right background  What you'll do:  Be customer focused - learn about the business to help bring value to our customers Act technology driven - design, implement, and test new functionality    Work closely with QA - we fix our own bugs       Work with Product Management to deliver material value to our clients      Do full stack dev from the DB to the UI       Use your experience to help the whole team get better  What you'll get:           Market rate salary based on experience          An amazing on-boarding experience on Shareworks, Dev Culture, How we do things and even ""reforming"" you from .Net to Java           Participation in annual bonus plan and stock incentives   Share Purchase Plan with company contributions (we are public and profitable!)            Casual Environment - we aren’t a bank, they just happen to be clients 20 Paid Days off + 11 stat holidays (and 5 week sabbatical after 5 years) The occasional spontaneous Nerf War Relocation Assistance available for the right candidates  If you've read this far and you're thinking ""I want to be a part of this"", we agree!
