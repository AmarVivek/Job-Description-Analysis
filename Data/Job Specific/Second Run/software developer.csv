We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 40 employees and $25M annual revenue over the past five years.  As a 100% remote company ( https://remote.co/company/collage-com/ ), we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. Collage.com’s co-founders/co-CEOs both come from a technical background and believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test ( https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/ ) (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we’re a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree ( https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree ) with React ( https://reactjs.org/ ).

This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team’s growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers. If you are seeking an environment where you get to do meaningful work with other great engineers, then we want to hear from you.

We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills.  We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack.  During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company.

As a 100% remote company ( https://remote.co/company/collage-com/ ), we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. Collage.com’s co-founders/co-CEOs both come from a technical background and believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test ( https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/ ) (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we’re a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree ( https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree ) with React ( https://reactjs.org/ ).

We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers.

The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack.

341,    WestJet,software developer,"Position Title: Director, Solutions Delivery – Commercial Portfolio  Employment Terms: Permanent Full-Time  Reporting to: Vice President, Solutions Delivery  Location: Calgary, AB  COMPANY BACKGROUND WestJet (TSX: WJA) is an iconic Canadian brand. Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, WestJet, along with regional carrier WestJet Encore, is Canada’s leading high-value, low-cost carrier. WestJet is continually recognized as one of the top employers in the country and one of Canada’s most admired corporate cultures. In 2017, WestJet celebrated its 50th consecutive quarter of profitability, and was recognized as the only Canadian airline with investment grade credit ratings. Founded as a regional carrier in Calgary in 1996, with 3 aircraft and 220 employees, WestJet has experienced momentous growth. Today, WestJet is a thriving international airline operated by 13,000+ employees, collectively known as WestJetters. Through scheduled flights across a rapidly expanding network, WestJet also operates WestJet Vacations (providing air, hotel, car and excursion packages), and WestJet Encore (a regional airline operating in Canada and the United States). WestJet is embarking upon a transformative era, transitioning from a low-cost carrier (LCC) to a global, full service network carrier with the delivery of Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft in January 2019. Further, WestJet has recently launched an ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), Swoop, a wholly owned subsidiary, with first flights scheduled in June 2018. The mission of WestJet is “to enrich the lives of everyone in WestJet's world.” Since inception, WestJet has nurtured its employee-focused culture of care, planning for its culture at the strategic level. WestJet expresses its strong corporate culture and commitment to guest service with the employee slogan “Because Owners Care.” This refers to the fact that approximately 86 percent of eligible employees, referred to as WestJetters, participate in an employee share purchase plan. Tying the personal success of WestJetters to the company’s success helps nurture a corporate culture that is focused on safety, exceptional guest service and cost containment. Further, with an average age of 40, WestJetters are among the youngest across all North American carriers. This has influenced the airline to create an open-minded, communicative and transparent culture. WestJet has recently unveiled a refreshed set of values, built over the last two years by WestJetters. These values and the behaviours that accompany them will set the stage for global expansion in a way that is uniquely WestJet: Act like an Owner: I take responsibility for my decisions and accountability for the outcomes. Care from the Heart: I do the right thing and do things right, because I care. Rise to the Challenge: I have the courage of a champion, relentless in my pursuit of excellence. Work Together to Win: I play my part, connecting as one team. Together we fly. By keeping a commitment to low costs, WestJet continues to offer value to its people, its shareholders and above all, its guests. It is on these fundamental beliefs that WestJet has built its four-pillar strategy: People and Culture: Putting our people first goes beyond fostering an environment of caring and commitment. We are all owners – empowered and accountable for making the right decisions for our guests and our business. Operational Excellence: Delivering great guest value is the most important part of what we do. If there is one thing that will continue to separate us from the rest, it is how we treat our guests, and providing the ultimate guest experience. Diversified, Sustainable Revenue Growth: Growing strategically and profitably means taking advantage of smart growth opportunities, and understanding the wants and needs of travelers. We will continue to add new destinations and gain market share. Financial strength: Keeping our low-cost advantage is simple. We will continue to offer value to our guests and our shareholders by providing the best guest experience in the industry, while achieving a targeted, sustainable profit margin that will be No. 1 among North American airlines.
