Our platform unites travelers, partners and bus companies throughout the world to move an increasingly large share of the entire industry online to increase access and improve the travel experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our people, technology and approach have been instrumental in getting us this far, but we have so much more to do, and that&#039;s where you come in. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What do we expect from you?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Busbud is looking for a &lt;strong&gt;senior Developer&lt;/strong&gt; with a diversified experience to join our team of talented developers.

You&#039;ll balance iteration and A/B testing with risk-taking and greenfielding. You&#039;ll routinely work with modern tools like React, Node and SASS on the frontend, and Node, Redis and Postgres on the backend. You&#039;ll share your wisdom with a team that values learning and experimenting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Depending on the task, you may own the feature end to end, or work with other team members to bring it to life together.

Our A/V setup isn&#039;t perfect (yet!), but it&#039;s gotten pretty good :)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Many of us have kids, others hobbies, and sometimes both, so we encourage a sane work/life balance. If you want to work like crazy, we&#039;ll take that too - you&#039;ll be in good company with the team&#039;s night owls&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;We use science (A/B tests) and customer feedback (interviews, support, live chat) to determine the impact of our work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We serve over 10M bus departures daily through our API, website and apps, and we&#039;re constantly looking for ways to improve our performance and availability without overwhelming the bus companies that supply us with the data - there are lots of challenges in this area around failure mitigation, latency compensation, cache optimization and much more&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We help travelers in over 60 countries, so we have all kinds of competitors keeping us on our toes, and we need to find ways of providing value to our users to keep them coming back to Busbud to find and buy what is essentially a commodity product. This is a constant challenge which we meet with creativity and taking risks. As much as we can, we deploy explicit and intentional effort to improve diversity in tech and also help upskill the next generation of developers through internship programs, mentoring and hosting, organizing or sponsoring relevant events.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There&#039;s a lot more, and if you&#039;re still reading, then you should hop over to the blog and our tech blog.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;em&gt;Busbud is committed to equal employment opportunity for all employees and to providing its team members with a work environment free from discrimination and harassment.

You&#039;ll share your wisdom with a team that values learning and experimenting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Depending on the task, you may own the feature end to end, or work with other team members to bring it to life together. We expect you to feel at home on the frontend in user experience land as much as on the server modeling data and improving performance, in the build optimizing asset delivery and everywhere in between. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Given Busbud&#039;s all javascript stack (with some Typescript making an appearance), and depending on your interests, you&#039;ll also have the opportunity to work on preventing fraud, improving how we communicate with customers, how we interface with supplier systems, upgrading our global architecture, monitoring, and much more. We&#039;ve got lots of challenges from which to choose! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How can you impress us?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You might recognize a few of these from Camille Fournier&#039;s RTR post, which we&#039;ve used to build our own career path ladder. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As an Intermediate or Senior developer, you  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Have shaped broad architecture, having shipped multiple large services, complex libraries or major pieces of infrastructure (5+ years)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Are sought out for technical guidance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Are recognized as a prolific contributor to core and side projects&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Love what you do, and sweat the details&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You&#039;re comfortable with (or can quickly ramp up) with some key ingredients in our tech stack: Javascript, NodeJS, React, Redis, Postgres, CDNs and caches, REST APIs and Heroku&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; At Busbud, you will  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be an owner and expert on large sections of our codebase, initially the website and related services&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Anticipate technical issues at the product level and make architectural and design decisions to avoid them&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Exemplify software development excellence balancing scope and deadlines to deliver on quality and speed with appropriate test coverage, monitoring and rollout plans&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Multiply the effectiveness of peers by facilitating cross-team work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Make our pages and site fast, beautiful, accessible and great for our users&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Delight Google and other search engines with your thoughtful use of sitemaps, interlinking, annotated content and other tactics to help travelers find buses.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Whats in it for you?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Compensation based on experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;4 weeks of vacation (3 weeks + holiday season)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Health Benefits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stock options&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Apple equipment&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Breakfast snacks, team lunch on Wednesdays, happy hour on Fridays&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Team events&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A beautiful office in Montreals burgeoning tech neighbourhood, Mile End&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What&#039;s it like working as a Developer at Busbud?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;You get the tools you need to be successful: laptop, big screen, comfy chair and desk and whatever else you might need to do your best work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We invest in our tool chain so you can focus on building: we&#039;ve got instrumentation, monitoring, logging, continuous integration, continuous deployments, crowd testing, managed translations and much more.

Our A/V setup isn&#039;t perfect (yet!), but it&#039;s gotten pretty good :)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Many of us have kids, others hobbies, and sometimes both, so we encourage a sane work/life balance. If you want to work like crazy, we&#039;ll take that too - you&#039;ll be in good company with the team&#039;s night owls&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We use science (A/B tests) and customer feedback (interviews, support, live chat) to determine the impact of our work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We serve over 10M bus departures daily through our API, website and apps, and we&#039;re constantly looking for ways to improve our performance and availability without overwhelming the bus companies that supply us with the data - there are lots of challenges in this area around failure mitigation, latency compensation, cache optimization and much more&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We help travelers in over 60 countries, so we have all kinds of competitors keeping us on our toes, and we need to find ways of providing value to our users to keep them coming back to Busbud to find and buy what is essentially a commodity product. This is a constant challenge which we meet with creativity and taking risks.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;As much as we can, we deploy explicit and intentional effort to improve diversity in tech and also help upskill the next generation of developers through internship programs, mentoring and hosting, organizing or sponsoring relevant events.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There&#039;s a lot more, and if you&#039;re still reading, then you should hop over to the blog and our tech blog.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;em&gt;Busbud is committed to equal employment opportunity for all employees and to providing its team members with a work environment free from discrimination and harassment.

You'll balance iteration and A/B testing with risk-taking and greenfielding. You'll routinely work with modern tools like React, Node and SASS on the frontend, and our CDN. You'll share your wisdom with a team that values learning and experimenting.  Depending on the task, you may own the feature end to end, or work with other team members to bring it to life together.

Our platform unites travelers, partners and bus companies throughout the world to move an increasingly large share of the entire industry online to increase access and improve the travel experience.

You'll routinely work with modern tools like React, Node and SASS on the frontend, and Node, Redis and Postgres on the backend. You'll share your wisdom with a team that values learning and experimenting. Depending on the task, you may own the feature end to end, or work with other team members to bring it to life together.
