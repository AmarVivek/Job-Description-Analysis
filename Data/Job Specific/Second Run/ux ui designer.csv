5883,McMillan,ux ui designer,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you eager to be part of a creative agency that treats designing for a better user experience—like the quality of work and work life at the agency itself—not as an afterthought, but rather as an essential driver of its continuing growth and financial success?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you prepared to sometimes do things differently, in the belief that doing great work, in a great environment, can be both fun and rewarding?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If so, read on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At McMillan, the UX team philosophy is simple: Know your user, and always strive to make his or her life better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Isn’t it great when your job description can be articulated in a way that’s both succinct and loaded with significance? That’s the kind of job you have as a UX designer at McMillan. What you do is enhance the user experience for the solutions we deliver. You serve as the advocate for unseen but knowable personas, while researching and producing various UX deliverables to give direction for end solutions based on learned business and user needs and objectives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In your role, you’ll report to and support the leader, digital experience, while collaborating daily with others in the strategy department and individuals in our digital, creative, client services, and studio management teams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Your responsibilities&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Expect to be busy. You’ll spend your days at McMillan alternating between:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Planning and conducting user and stakeholder research activities, including interviews, card sorting, tree testing, and usability testing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Producing polished UX documentation, including competitive/heuristic analyses, personas, site maps, user journeys, and flows&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Translating insights into user-centred deliverables, including information architectures, user scenarios, and wireframes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Developing static and interactive prototypes for demonstration and evaluation of concepts by clients, or for testing with end users&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Providing UX insight and guidance to clients and internal teams&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Working with visual designers and developers to bring concepts to life, while maintaining UX best practices&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Creating and leading client presentations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout, you’ll need to be a patient listener and confident communicator.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Your success&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;It starts, of course, by carrying out your responsibilities in a way that adds value. You take your role seriously (yourself less so), and you are comfortable with change. In fact, you encourage and champion it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there’s something else. Win or lose, we do it as a team. At the same time, all employees at McMillan are expected to strive towards being recognized as sought-after, trusted advisors by clients and colleagues alike. That recognition is earned by displaying:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curiosity&lt;/strong&gt; – You show a genuine interest in coworkers and ask tough questions (when appropriate) to inform, explore, and encourage fresh perspectives and solutions. At the same time, you seek to continuously widen and improve your own knowledge and skills, so that you can generate ideas that are both informed and unexpected.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expertise&lt;/strong&gt; – You combine expert proficiency in your role with industry-specific awareness. You exude confidence, yet know when receiving constructive feedback is important. In fact, a critical part of the McMillan culture embraces both giving and receiving feedback in the moment, to make all of us better people and turn good work into something that’s great.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt; – You communicate clearly, stay calm under pressure, anticipate the needs of others, respond promptly to requests, show a sincere desire to build relationships, and prove yourself to be a reliable, go-to player on the McMillan team.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;b&gt;You bring&lt;/b&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;5+ years’ experience as a UX professional (or in a similar role)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A firm understanding of user-centred design processes and interaction design principles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Previous experience in planning and conducting various user research activities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Proficiency in a variety of design prototyping tools, including Sketch, Adobe CS, Invision, Axure, and Omnigraffle&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experience working in a creative agency will be considered an asset.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;b&gt;You should expect&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Travel and overtime may be required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think you have what it takes?

5900,Opus One Solutions,ux ui designer,"&lt;strong&gt;Who we are:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Creating a planet fueled by reliable, clean energy isnt what keeps us up at night; its what gets us out of bed. At Opus One Solutions, we pursue solutions that will change how countries access and distribute electrical energy. From microgrids that keep things running in the event of an outage to how Tesla&#039;s latest batteries can help accelerate the integration of renewable energy. From how electric utilities can optimize their operations and reduce their carbon footprint to how every homeowner will feed energy into a power grid fueling the electrical sharing economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; At Opus One Solutions, we believe some of the best talent in the tech industry share our passion for delivering technology that matters and that will make a difference, in our lifetime and beyond. We want to work with people who love the complexities of software; who believe in its power to transform the world into a better place. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Good people know that great ideas are everywhere and what matters most is practical execution. Turning vision into reality is the hard part. But, when its creating technical solutions that support access to renewable energy, its an engineering feat worth contributing to. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Opus One Solutions is looking for a UI/UX Designer who will be entrusted with guiding the development of our all-important UX. We need someone who is passionate about designing innovative, engaging products that deliver both business value and a great experience for users. A Designer who is able to build great relationships with subject matter experts and convert their knowledge of energy and power systems into actionable designs. Someone who has the maturity to champion their design choices while respecting the work and input of the experts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is a role for a UI/UX Designer who wants to gather requirements, present ideas, make decisions and create rapid prototypes. Someone who approaches complex information with straightforward questions, who knows how to get detailed information from power systems people and how to drill down to the essence of what is needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What is GridOS?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our flagship product, GridOS is a first-of-its-kind tool designed to empower utilities to take control of their grid and in the process accelerate the adoption of renewable energy. It combines a core analytics engine, a suite of I/O integrations and a rich web-based user interface to take a sea of real-world data and help utilities plan for optimally operated grids with modern energy resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Who are you?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You are a UI/UX Designer with a passion for transforming technical user stories into engaging and intuitive designs. You thrive in the role of UI/UX champion, representing both the voice of the end-user and the best practices in your field. You are looking for a company with a purpose, one that is in an exciting growth phase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You might be working at a large design or web consultancy, moving from one client project to another. Or, you might be at a late-stage startup where you are the one-stop-shop for design from wireframing to graphics; taking requirements to functional prototypes. You have a virtual artists palette and a toolbox of technologies you use to demonstrate your training and your instinct. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Whats in it for you?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Challenges. The electrical power grid is a lifeline to millions of people. It is also an incredibly complex network being controlled by archaic software that was designed decades before UX was a thing. Your challenge is taking power systems blueprints and real-time data about the grid and translate that into an intuitive and easy to understand UX. Think Google maps for electricity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A chance to make an impact. The projects you will work on will be not just local or national but global firsts-of-their-kind. You will set the tone for everything that follows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Personal and professional satisfaction. You want to do meaningful work.

You want to build technology solutions that matter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Heres what our UI/UX Designer will do:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Own it. You will take on responsibility for the UI and UX of the application, ensuring a clean, elegant interface with logical transitions and a user-friendly, intuitive workflow.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Bring it to life. You will convert complex business requirements into pixel perfect designs; bringing them to life with a variety of usability techniques.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Design. You will design intuitive interfaces, logical task workflows and responsive layouts that meet the needs and vision of the product team and the end-user.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create. You will provide insights and create wireframes, storyboards, user flows and sitemaps. You will present concepts that are scalable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Collaborate. You will work across teams, with in-house and offshore developers to ensure the design is aligned with the business needs and implemented as designed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Heres what you bring:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Award-winning user interface building experience. You have 3-5 years working on UI and UX design with an emphasis on creating rich user experiences with clean UI layout and responsive performance. Experience with B2B design is a bonus. A related degree is an asset.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A portfolio of your recent work demonstrating your ability to deliver eye-catching, intuitive, and engaging customer experiences including responsive web applications. You understand accessibility design requirements and best practices.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A virtual palette. You have used a range of tools and technologies:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adobe Creative Suite (expert)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A workload prioritisation tool such as TFS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A wireframing / prototyping tool such as Omnigraffle, Balsamiq, Axure, Visio, Gliffy, Invision, Sketch, Figma - whatever your preferred tool is; you have the expertise.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Translation skills.

6002,BenchSci,ux ui designer,"You&#039;ve read job posts that promise you&#039;ll change the world. Then you discover they&#039;re for yet another social media app, marketing agency, or consulting firm. You click away. And you wonder: &#034;Aren&#039;t there opportunities where I can make a big impact? While I earn recognition and rewards for my efforts? And get to work with exceptional people on exciting new technology?&#034; If that sounds like you, meet BenchSci. You will be a great fit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About us&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We use machine learning to accelerate drug discovery by helping scientists execute successful experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We focus on a huge problem in drug discovery&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Each year, biomedical researchers waste over a billion combined hours. The problem is with products they purchase to influence and measure proteins. There are millions of them, from hundreds of vendors. Finding the right products for specific experiments is tough. Researchers spend hours and sometimes days searching through published papers for guidance. But even then, many products they buy don&#039;t work. Some aren&#039;t right for a specific experiment. Others are poor quality. This delays scientific discoveries by weeks or months. And it slows availability of breakthrough treatments while making them more expensive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We apply artificial intelligence to solve it&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thanks to improvements in machine learning, we can now solve this problem. We spent more than two years teaching a computer to read science papers like a human scientist. It decodes the information, which we present to researchers in an easy-to-use, web-based platform. They can then find products for experiments in minutes, not days, and see data that builds trust. The time and money they save has led to rapid adoption by top pharmaceutical companies and hundreds of academic institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Product video&lt;/strong&gt;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPs5xzYYHSs &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;News about us:&lt;/strong&gt; https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alphabets-ai-venture-capital-firm-makes-first-investment-in-canada/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If our story excites you, let us describe who we would love on our team.

6133,BenchSci,ux ui designer,"You&#039;ve read job posts that promise you&#039;ll change the world. Then you discover they&#039;re for yet another social media app, marketing agency, or consulting firm. You click away. And you wonder: &#034;Aren&#039;t there opportunities where I can make a big impact? While I earn recognition and rewards for my efforts? And get to work with exceptional people on exciting new technology?&#034; If that sounds like you, meet BenchSci. You will be a great fit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About us&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We use machine learning to accelerate drug discovery by helping scientists execute successful experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We focus on a huge problem in drug discovery&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Each year, biomedical researchers waste over a billion combined hours. The problem is with products they purchase to influence and measure proteins. There are millions of them, from hundreds of vendors. Finding the right products for specific experiments is tough. Researchers spend hours and sometimes days searching through published papers for guidance. But even then, many products they buy don&#039;t work. Some aren&#039;t right for a specific experiment. Others are poor quality. This delays scientific discoveries by weeks or months. And it slows availability of breakthrough treatments while making them more expensive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We apply artificial intelligence to solve it&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thanks to improvements in machine learning, we can now solve this problem. We spent more than two years teaching a computer to read science papers like a human scientist. It decodes the information, which we present to researchers in an easy-to-use, web-based platform. They can then find products for experiments in minutes, not days, and see data that builds trust. The time and money they save has led to rapid adoption by top pharmaceutical companies and hundreds of academic institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Product video&lt;/strong&gt;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPs5xzYYHSs &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;News about us:&lt;/strong&gt; https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alphabets-ai-venture-capital-firm-makes-first-investment-in-canada/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If our story excites you, let us describe who we would love on our team.

We enjoy coming to work every day because we believe in our product and L.O.V.E. our culture. Achievers is more than just a software company; we are industry leaders in the HR space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are passionate about making products that people love, deeply care about humans, and have an empathic approach to design that helps you make it all come to life, we want to hear from you. We’re looking for a team member who has a contagious drive for learning, acquiring new skills and perspectives, and who cares about sharing their insights to learn and grow as a team – this is our secret weapon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You have produced top-notch quality work. You have sound design intuition and believe in having a process from beginning to end – from wireframes, task flows, crystal clear mock ups, and interaction designs. Your portfolio should illustrate your achievements, and you believe that your best work is still ahead of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We might be a good match if...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You believe in craftsmanship and endeavor to create elegant and compelling designs, over and over.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Your portfolio has some best-in-class work. You&#039;re a walking encyclopedia of microinteractions in use (on mobile, web, desktop, etc), and have nuanced views on how to make many of them even better.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt; You’ve shipped product.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;You’ve weathered release cycles and know what details matter at each stage, how to motivate engineers to get the fit and finish right, how to translate insights from user studies into meaningful action, and what’s most likely to go afoul at each stage. You can share several shining examples of real work you&#039;ve shipped, and what you learned along the way.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You have designed and shipped multiple apps, or have gone through multiple release cycles on a larger project.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Cross-platform is your style.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Hopefully you’ve shipped something across several platforms. You know what translates from desktop and what doesn’t, or why you’d opt for one solution for iOS and another on Android.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You know that a good design requires research and multiple iterations.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;You are able to explain how your best work came to be, and you can show us the processes you went through.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You know all modern design practices by heart and can be creative to come up with better solutions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Prototyping is a key part of your toolset.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;You’ve prototyped on multiple platforms. You’ve made last-minute tweaks between user studies. You know how to be all kinds of quick and dirty, but dream of better prototyping tools.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You substantially contribute to defining the &#039;what&#039; as well as the &#039;how&#039;.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;You&#039;re a product manager&#039;s secret weapon. You thrive best when helping to define the requirements, not just translating them into designs. You facilitate and draw the best design ideas from teammates.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You&#039;ll also be working with Engineering to design and implement beautiful, intuitive experiences. That means you&#039;ll need to not only be a great designer, but also be able to understand and write a little code.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You can think and talk about the bottom line.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Analytics don’t scare you, and you know which tools you can use to find the data you&#039;d need to make a (design) decision, and are comfortable with searching our databases to get the data you need.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What will you do?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Design thoughtful user experiences and great looking product UI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Form the vision for winning application solutions, collaborating with Product Managers, Senior Management, Development, Professional Services, Customer Success and Marketing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Work closely with the Product team to create exceptional wireframes, process flows, mock-ups and other design documentation.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Deeply understand and validate the needs of current and targeted customers through quantitative &amp; qualitative customer research.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Test and refine flows with internal &amp; external stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Collaborate and share ideas and concepts as a strategic member of a dynamic product team.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Work with the design team to define and refine the patterns, templates and components that are used across the platform.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  Qualifications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Extensive experience designing beautiful customer experiences for the web, iPhone, iPad or Android.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;4+ years experience that includes UI, UX, and interaction design.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Solid portfolio (show us everything from rough sketches to high-fidelity designs).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Excellent knowledge of the Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch and other graphic design / prototyping tools.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Proficiency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript frameworks.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You possess an intensely collaborative spirit.

The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel connect your body to the digital world, creating what we call your Digital Identity. This data is uploaded to the cloud and can be shared with those who matter to you - your doctors, coaches, other IoT devices, your family members - without you consciously having to think about it. Imagine a world where you walk into your house and the temperature automatically adjusts to suit you, or the lights adjust to your mood, or your doctor is aware of the onset of a disease before you even visit.

9393,    Opus One Solutions,ux ui designer,"Who we are: Creating a planet fueled by reliable, clean energy isn’t what keeps us up at night; it’s what gets us out of bed. At Opus One Solutions, we pursue solutions that will change how countries access and distribute electrical energy. From microgrids that keep things running in the event of an outage to how Tesla's latest batteries can help accelerate the integration of renewable energy. From how electric utilities can optimize their operations and reduce their carbon footprint to how every homeowner will feed energy into a power grid fueling the electrical sharing economy. At Opus One Solutions, we believe some of the best talent in the tech industry share our passion for delivering technology that matters and that will make a difference, in our lifetime and beyond. We want to work with people who love the complexities of software; who believe in its power to transform the world into a better place. Good people know that great ideas are everywhere and what matters most is practical execution. Turning vision into reality is the hard part. But, when it’s creating technical solutions that support access to renewable energy, it’s an engineering feat worth contributing to. The opportunity Opus One Solutions is looking for a UI/UX Designer who will be entrusted with guiding the development of our all-important UX. We need someone who is passionate about designing innovative, engaging products that deliver both business value and a great experience for users. A Designer who is able to build great relationships with subject matter experts and convert their knowledge of energy and power systems into actionable designs. Someone who has the maturity to champion their design choices while respecting the work and input of the experts. This is a role for a UI/UX Designer who wants to gather requirements, present ideas, make decisions and create rapid prototypes. Someone who approaches complex information with straightforward questions, who knows how to get detailed information from power systems people and how to drill down to the essence of what is needed. What is GridOS? Our flagship product, GridOS is a first-of-its-kind tool designed to empower utilities to take control of their grid and in the process accelerate the adoption of renewable energy.

You have a virtual artist’s palette and a toolbox of technologies you use to demonstrate your training and your instinct. What’s in it for you? Challenges. The electrical power grid is a lifeline to millions of people. It is also an incredibly complex network being controlled by archaic software that was designed decades before UX was a thing. Your challenge is taking power systems blueprints and real-time data about the grid and translate that into an intuitive and easy to understand UX. Think Google maps for electricity.

It’s hair-standing-up-on-end-exhilarating. It’s down-in-the-trenches-challenging. Its stroke-of-brilliance-at-midnight creative. It’s you—taking risks, challenging yourself, pursuing ideas, changing the way millions of people do something they love: Play. We’re EA—we’ve been making games for decades but you wouldn’t know that walking through our studios. We’re still buzzing with the same innovative spirit we began with, though we’ve learned enough to earn our rank as a leading developer, publisher and distributor of the world’s best games. What began as a small group of people determined to “put real life in a box” has become an 8,000-people strong, worldwide organization delivering on that very dream. If you’ve played The Sims lately, you know exactly what we mean. And if you’ve played Battlefield 1, maybe you’d say that we’ve done real life one better.  Whether you’re building Springfield on your mobile or your palms are sweaty from clutching your controller during intense games of FIFA 17, chances are you’ve played an EA game. And if you haven’t, well, what are you waiting for? In an industry that’s changing every day—whether it’s through new social channels, advancing technology, new audiences or unique opportunities for monetization—EA is positioned for growth thanks to smart business plans, strategic acquisitions, and most importantly, our creative people around the world who gather each day to unite the world through play.
