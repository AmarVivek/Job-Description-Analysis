We’ve likely had this passion since we were kids, when we first started programming. We’re also relentless tinkerers who embrace new challenges. Can we accomplish this task, learn something new, and work together towards a common goal? We ask those and other questions with each new assignment. There’s never one right idea, after all, and there are always compromises to make. Often, they lead to better outcomes. And, at the end of the day, there’s a client—as well as our colleagues—to impress.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As a senior developer at M&lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;Millan, you’re renowned for a special talent: you can problem-solve or code the &lt;em&gt;sh!t&lt;/em&gt; out of whatever you lay your hands on. That skill will be called on a lot, given that your role will be to lead development on major projects, provide advice and guidance to other developers, and act as a key advisor on all topics digital. And, while the position is open to teleworkers from across Canada, you’ll be associated with a leading-edge digital environment—the kind that will make your friends jealous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In your role, you’ll report to, and support, M&lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;Millan’s associate director, technology, while collaborating daily with others in your department and individuals in our client services, creative, and studio management teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expect to be busy. You’ll spend your days at M&lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;Millan:  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Coding HTML/CSS/JavaScript websites and components&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Coding back-end technologies such as ASP.NET or NodeJS&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Planning projects, including estimating efforts, devising implementation strategies and tactics, and shaping code design&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Providing digital guidance to creative directors, art directors, designers, and client service teammates&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Throughout, you’ll need to be a patient listener and confident communicator with a firm grasp of established goals and metrics for shared success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It starts, of course, by carrying out your responsibilities in a way that adds value. You take your role seriously (yourself less so), and you are comfortable with change. In fact, you encourage and champion it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But there’s something else. Win or lose, we do it as a team. At the same time, all employees at M&lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;Millan are expected to strive towards being recognized as sought-after, trusted advisors by clients and colleagues alike. That recognition is earned by displaying:  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curiosity&lt;/strong&gt; – You show a genuine interest in coworkers and ask tough questions (when appropriate) to inform, explore, and encourage fresh perspectives and solutions.

We focus on the customer and the entire journey, including traditional marketing, sales, and service, as well as orchestrating online and mobile commerce and other interaction channels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  This paradigm change is driven by SAP’s business unit Cloud Business Group (CBG) and its cornerstone brand SAP hybris. Within SAP hybris, the product “SAP Hybris Marketing Cloud” plays a dominant role and is a major growth opportunity. Our mission is to deliver the world’s leading Marketing Suite, enabling marketers to engage throughout the whole customer journey in all channels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Following the principles of agile software development, we cherish direct feedback from customers by including them in design thinking workshops. Design thinking incorporates the idea of failing early and smart during the design phase rather than during customer usage. We test several different approaches to understand the design from different angles and especially from the customer’s point of view. Thus, we work out problems in an early phase–while enjoying the interactive design process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  We are seeking an individual who is self-motivated and passionate about Software development and who is eager to be part of a self-organizing, young and dynamic team but also has a strong focus and interest in development, automation, and quality in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;EXPECTATIONS AND TASKS&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Working through the entire Software lifecycle, by: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Designing and developing software per product owner specifications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making excellent use of Test Driven Development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delivering high quality software by implementing necessary QA activities (ex. integration tests, unit tests, test automation)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contributing to product documentation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining already released software&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being an active contributor in an Agile development team&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being flexible to take on additional tasks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contributing to team spirit and health&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By completing these tasks, you will play a crucial role to building the marketing cloud of the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS / SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Required skills &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; From experience, we know that a bachelor’s or master’s degree in software engineering or computer science is a good starting point for your development career in our Cloud Business Group. As part of an interdisciplinary and international team, we build on your communication skills as a team player and your fluency in the English language. While employing the principles of design thinking, your analytical skills enable you to learn from every failure and to go forward with every iteration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Customers are at the very heart of what we do. The ability to multitask and prioritize is very important to solve error situations which are very stressful for our customers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Having said this, you should have some solid software development skills and a passion to build meaningful, usable, and high-quality applications for people like yourself: customers.

But to help you a little more, here are some things we’d like to see in you, considering we’re going to be sharing a space with you for almost a quarter of a year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ·   You have a strong eye for design who uses this super-power as a tool to solve real world problems. Our tool kit involves everything from whiteboards and dry-erase markers for ideation to Sketch and InVision for high-fidelity interactive prototypes. And we&#039;re always playing around with new tools, so we invite any suggestions from you too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ·   You thrive in an entrepreneurial environment where you don’t always have the answers to the challenges you’re tackling but are eager to discover them. You accept the fact that you might fail a few times, but you persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ·   You get rapid prototyping. We’re all people with ideas and we love ideating together, but we’re partial to action. We operate in 2 week sprints in which we see our ideas go to demo-able state. You have to be comfortable with learning-while-doing as there will be plenty of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ·   You care about customer experiences. You don’t have to be a UX guru, but you should appreciate well-designed customer experiences and strive to work towards them in your projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ·   You are a naturally curious person and are not afraid to try new things. Usually this is best demonstrated by side-projects or attendances at hackathons or the like. Either way, the more you can tell us about your personal initiatives, the more brownie points you get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of the above struck a chord with you, then let&#039;s talk! Help us in making financial services better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Votre profil&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Si vous avez lu jusqu’ici, vous êtes sur le bon chemin. Mais pour améliorer vos chances, voici une liste des compétences qui nous intéressent, étant donné que nous allons nous côtoyer pendant pratiquement un trimestre :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vous  êtes un excellent programmeur, et vous utilisez vos compétences pour  résoudre de réels problèmes. Bien que le RED Lab soit ouvert à toutes les  technologies, nous utilisons principalement HTML5, Javascript/node.js,  Angular et iOS. Nous sommes toujours curieux de savoir si vous souhaitez  approfondir certaines technologies.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vous  êtes dans votre élément quand l’esprit d’entreprise est à l’honneur; vous  n’avez pas toujours la réponse aux défis qui vous sont lancés, mais vous  faites tout pour l’obtenir. Vous savez que le succès n’est pas garanti,  mais vous persistez.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vous  OBTENEZ rapidement des prototypes. Nous avons tous plein d’idées et nous  adorons en discuter ensemble, mais nous avons une préférence pour  l’action. Nous travaillons dans des sprints rapides de deux semaines  durant lesquels nous partons d’une idée et en concevons une version de  démonstration. Vous devez être à l’aise dans un contexte d’apprentissage  par l’action, car c’est de cela que seront faites vos journées.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vous  vous souciez de l’expérience des clients. Nous ne vous demandons pas  d’être un gourou de l’expérience utilisateur, mais une bonne expérience  client est importante à vos yeux et cela fait partie de vos objectifs  lorsque vous menez un projet.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vous  avez une soif insatiable de créer. Que vous tentiez de l’étancher dans le  cadre de marathons de programmation, de projets que vous menez en  parallèle ou de vos propres entreprises en démarrage, vous avez la  curiosité et les aptitudes techniques nécessaires pour réussir ici. Plus  vous avez de choses à nous raconter sur vos projets personnels, plus vous  nous intéressez.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Si l’un des éléments susmentionnés vous parle, faites-nous signe! Aidez-nous à améliorer les services financiers pour tout le monde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Manulife&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manulife is a leading Canada-based financial services group with principal operations in Canada, Asia and the United States.

5262,BenchSci,ai machine learning developer,"You&#039;ve read job posts that promise you&#039;ll change the world. Then you discover they&#039;re for yet another social media app, marketing agency, or consulting firm. You click away. And you wonder: &#034;Aren&#039;t there opportunities where I can make a big impact? While I earn recognition and rewards for my efforts? And get to work with exceptional people on exciting new technology?&#034; If that sounds like you, meet BenchSci. You will be a great fit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About us&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We use machine learning to accelerate drug discovery by helping scientists execute successful experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We focus on a huge problem in drug discovery&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Each year, biomedical researchers waste over a billion combined hours. The problem is with products they purchase to influence and measure proteins. There are millions of them, from hundreds of vendors. Finding the right products for specific experiments is tough. Researchers spend hours and sometimes days searching through published papers for guidance. But even then, many products they buy don&#039;t work. Some aren&#039;t right for a specific experiment. Others are poor quality. This delays scientific discoveries by weeks or months. And it slows availability of breakthrough treatments while making them more expensive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We apply artificial intelligence to solve it&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thanks to improvements in machine learning, we can now solve this problem. We spent more than two years teaching a computer to read science papers like a human scientist. It decodes the information, which we present to researchers in an easy-to-use, web-based platform. They can then find products for experiments in minutes, not days, and see data that builds trust. The time and money they save has led to rapid adoption by top pharmaceutical companies and hundreds of academic institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Product video&lt;/strong&gt;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPs5xzYYHSs &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;News about us:&lt;/strong&gt; https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alphabets-ai-venture-capital-firm-makes-first-investment-in-canada/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If our story excites you, let us describe who we would love on our team.

We are a talented, fun and dynamic group that thrive on getting the job done. We&#039;re hiring a Head of Software Architecture in Montreal or Toronto. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What you&#039;ll do&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Software architecture is a critical part of creating usable, reliable and trustworthy AI systems. Due to the recency of the AI field and the lack of established best practices, software architecture often takes a back seat to engineering and research considerations. As a result, the world is full of bloated and unreliable AI solutions that fail to delight their users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; At Element AI, were not satisfied with the status quo. We have a strong focus on the intangibles of software: architecture, design, user experience and agility. The Head of Software Architecture will ensure that architecture is a strength of the company: defining (as a joint effort with the Chief Architect and other architects in the company), implementing and maintaining our vision of software architecture as it pertains to AI and ensuring that it is used and optimally consistent across the company. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is an influential leadership role; you will work with software architects embedded in the research, development and product teams, and with our solution architects working with customers (but your impact comes from your experience and your ability to improve outcomes). You can develop and evangelize a vision, but youre not dogmatic and can equally help to make it practical and beneficial in the short term.

More importantly, you are very strong analytically: you usually know the outcome of an experiment before its run due to a deep understanding of what is happening under the covers. You understand the many layers of software from IT up to the high level design, and people you work with seek you out for this reason. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You have existing knowledge of modern AI including deep learning and real-world deployment strategies. Your are proud of the strength of your communication skills and the breadth of your knowledge, and can have meaningful conversations about AI with nearly anybody. Youre known for listening to others, but others know to listen to you. You can operate with uncertainty and are comfortable in a fast moving startup environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This position will require some travel, with approximately one trip every month, and occasional speaking engagements at conferences and industry events.

We understand the evolving role of the CFO and Finance function and work with our clients to automate and streamline Efficiency, Control and Compliance functions, while simultaneously improving the value Finance provides to the organization. We assist our clients with business and internal finance performance improvement initiatives by providing business advisory services that result in the achievement of measurable benefits in financial and operational effectiveness, controls and strategic decision making.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;As a FAAS – SPA Senior Consultant, you will actively establish, maintain and strengthen internal and external relationships.

We’re a small and lean team of coders, designers, and geeks who love tackling business challenges using modern technologies while keeping our end-customers at the center of everything we do. We care deeply about the end user experience and subscribe to the idea of rapidly testing and iterating on solutions.  We’ve worked on a variety of technologies including web, iOS, hybrid apps, voice interfaces, and wearables – if it’s something that has a compelling potential to provide value to our business and customers, we’ll give it a serious consideration.  We typically work in rapid sprints closely with our business stakeholders who represent departments ranging from insurance to banking and everything in between. If getting experience across a variety of challenges, business and technical, is your cup of tea, then this is the café of choice.  Le laboratoire de recherche, d’exploration, de développement et de conception de Manuvie (RED Lab) est le centre de l’innovation de Manuvie Canada. Nous sommes une petite équipe de codeurs, de concepteurs et de technophiles aimant résoudre des problèmes qui touchent les affaires au moyen de technologies modernes, tout en plaçant constamment nos clients finaux au cœur de tout ce que nous faisons. Nous accordons une place importante à l’expérience de l’utilisateur final et adhérons à l’idée de rapidement effectuer des tests et reproduire le cycle de déploiement de solutions. Nous travaillons sur un éventail de technologies, y compris le Web, iOS, des applications hybrides, des interfaces vocales et des technologies prêt-à-porter. S’il s’agit d’un projet présentant un potentiel intéressant et pouvant apporter une valeur à notre entreprise et à nos clients, nous allons y songer sérieusement. Nous travaillons habituellement dans des sprints rapides, en collaborant étroitement avec nos parties prenantes qui représentent des services, comme les assurances ou les opérations bancaires, ou tout autre service. Si acquérir de l’expérience en surmontant divers obstacles opérationnels et techniques vous intéresse, alors n’hésitez pas à joindre nos rangs.  About the Role  If you were to sit in a time machine and travel a term into the future, you should be able to look back at your time here as a Solutions Prototype Design Co-op and be able to claim the following: I played with some of the coolest technologies on the market (e.g. Amazon Alexa or Apple’s Swift programming language) I worked on fun projects that solved meaningful problems to help make financial services better (e.g. built an Apple Watch app that tracks health information for insurance purposes) I built a handful of prototypes that I pitched and demoed to my peers and senior business stakeholders I worked with a rad team that challenges each other to keep questioning the status quo and push the boundaries in a lean and collaborative environment I had a lot of free food (no joke - Communitech has a bunch of networking events where free food and drinks are provided) À propos du poste Si vous pouviez voyager dans le temps et passer ainsi à la session suivante, vous devriez être en mesure de repenser à votre séjour à Manuvie en qualité de concepteur, Solutions prototypes, Programme coopératif et d’affirmer ce qui suit : J’ai joué avec certaines des technologies les plus géniales du marché (p. ex., l’appli Alexa d’Amazon ou le langage de programmation Swift d’Apple). J’ai travaillé sur des projets amusants qui ont permis de résoudre des problèmes importants et j’ai ainsi contribué à améliorer les services financiers (p. ex., le développement d’une appli Apple Watch qui fait le suivi de renseignements sur la santé aux fins d’assurance). J’ai construit quelques prototypes, et j’en ai fait la présentation et la démonstration à mes pairs et principaux partenaires d’affaires. J’ai travaillé avec une équipe cool dont les membres se mettent mutuellement au défi pour remettre en question le statu quo et repousser les limites, dans un esprit de simplicité et de collaboration. J’ai mangé gratuitement très souvent (sans blague, Communitech organise beaucoup d’événements de réseautage où la nourriture et les boissons sont fournies). Qualifications  About You  If you’ve read this far, you’re a pretty cool cat. But to help you a little more, here are some things we’d like to see in you, considering we’re going to be sharing a space with you for almost a quarter of a year:  You have a strong eye for design who uses this super-power as a tool to solve real world problems. Our tool kit involves everything from whiteboards and dry-erase markers for ideation to Sketch and InVision for high-fidelity interactive prototypes. And we're always playing around with new tools, so we invite any suggestions from you too. You thrive in an entrepreneurial environment where you don’t always have the answers to the challenges you’re tackling but are eager to discover them. You accept the fact that you might fail a few times, but you persist. You get rapid prototyping. We’re all people with ideas and we love ideating together, but we’re partial to action. We operate in 2 week sprints in which we see our ideas go to demo-able state. You have to be comfortable with learning-while-doing as there will be plenty of that. You care about customer experiences. You don’t have to be a UX guru, but you should appreciate well-designed customer experiences and strive to work towards them in your projects You are a naturally curious person and are not afraid to try new things. Usually this is best demonstrated by side-projects or attendances at hackathons or the like. Either way, the more you can tell us about your personal initiatives, the more brownie points you get.  If any of the above struck a chord with you, then let's talk! Help us in making financial services better for everyone.  Votre profil Si vous avez lu jusqu’ici, vous êtes sur le bon chemin. Mais pour améliorer vos chances, voici une liste des compétences qui nous intéressent, étant donné que nous allons nous côtoyer pendant pratiquement un trimestre : Vous êtes un excellent programmeur, et vous utilisez vos compétences pour résoudre de réels problèmes. Bien que le RED Lab soit ouvert à toutes les technologies, nous utilisons principalement HTML5, Javascript/node.js, Angular et iOS. Nous sommes toujours curieux de savoir si vous souhaitez approfondir certaines technologies. Vous êtes dans votre élément quand l’esprit d’entreprise est à l’honneur; vous n’avez pas toujours la réponse aux défis qui vous sont lancés, mais vous faites tout pour l’obtenir. Vous savez que le succès n’est pas garanti, mais vous persistez. Vous OBTENEZ rapidement des prototypes. Nous avons tous plein d’idées et nous adorons en discuter ensemble, mais nous avons une préférence pour l’action. Nous travaillons dans des sprints rapides de deux semaines durant lesquels nous partons d’une idée et en concevons une version de démonstration. Vous devez être à l’aise dans un contexte d’apprentissage par l’action, car c’est de cela que seront faites vos journées. Vous vous souciez de l’expérience des clients. Nous ne vous demandons pas d’être un gourou de l’expérience utilisateur, mais une bonne expérience client est importante à vos yeux et cela fait partie de vos objectifs lorsque vous menez un projet. Vous avez une soif insatiable de créer. Que vous tentiez de l’étancher dans le cadre de marathons de programmation, de projets que vous menez en parallèle ou de vos propres entreprises en démarrage, vous avez la curiosité et les aptitudes techniques nécessaires pour réussir ici.
