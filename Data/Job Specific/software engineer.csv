Experience and (just as important) interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA is a must for our team. This includes (walking down the stack): AngularJS/Angular SPA development, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed request handling services, no-SQL and relational SQL databases, big data processing (e.g. data bus architecture, Hadoop / MPP data warehouse, etc.), and data visualization (e.g. ESRI, Open Layers, D3, Tableau, Spotfire, Microsoft BI). Experience in all these layers is not strictly required, but we do like to see experience working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all (because they often will). You have a track record of significant, specific, and self-directed contributions to large and challenging projects. What we're getting at here is ""grit"" or ""street cred"" some proof that this isn’t your first rodeo, and you have learned some lessons the hard way. Also, it’s not just a job, but something you enjoy. You lead with humility and confidence. Our engineers have the opportunity (and are expected) to exercise a high degree of leadership and expertise in their daily work, having strongly held and defensible ideas, and advocating for what they believe is right. But they also need to be eager to hear differing opinions, adept at identifying and evaluating tradeoffs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to help out their follow teammates. You have 5-20 years of product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best - .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do a lot of development in C#/.NET, Java and Python, but specific experience here is not required.  What you'll do at IHS Markit Contribute to a cross-functional team building new capabilities for web based platforms. Monitor and support critical production services, while looking to continuously improve performance, resilience and transparency. Use your expertise to create next generation front end applications. Use your expertise to setup secure web and API integrations for external clients. Act as point of contact for the team on a rotating basis.  How you'll do it at IHS Markit Leverage your years of industry experience to provide your team with feedback and expertise, balancing a variety of roles including that of developer, architect, tester and technical writer. Satisfy your natural craving for problem solving by building and designing complex applications. You're smart and motivated enough to find a way, even if you don't know how yet.

We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills.  We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack.  During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company. We believe in transparency, and will give you the opportunity to speak with anyone else you’d like to meet before accepting an offer. You are making an important decision, and we want to make sure you are fully committed to joining our team."
